# = Gardenia design
	
# == Expected settings (via main admin)
# * version -- current version number of gardenia
# * hf_stretch -- true if use stretch headers & footers; false (nil) otherwise
# * nav_search -- true if place a search form in nav area
# * side_search -- true if place a search form in sidebar area

# these settings are created in config/initializers/application.rb if not yet 
# existent, which means that new settings can be added to the app on the fly and
# they will be functional. See comments in application.rb for details.
